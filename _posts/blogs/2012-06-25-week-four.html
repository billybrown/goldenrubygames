Greetings Friends,

We've been making some headway on our game. First off, we decided on an official name: Destroy All Color! It'll make sense once you play it.

As for the game itself, we met with <a href="http://artofmo.blogspot.com/">an artist </a>and <a href="http://www.jaybraun.com/">sound designer</a> last week. We think we're going to try and aim for a 1950's Space Alien feel. Check out some concept art below![gallery link="file"]

We're pretty happy with the direction this is going.

Check back for more updates!

-Mike
