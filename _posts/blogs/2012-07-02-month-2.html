Happy July Everyone,

After a busy 4 weeks, Golden Ruby is getting closer to completing our first game: <strong>Destroy All Color!</strong>

We've had a handful of game testers, complete overhaul of game mechanics, created over 100 levels and are finally getting art and sound into the game.

We're aiming for an August release date, so make sure to keep an eye out on further developments.

Below is some concept art of our main character K'roma. She's crash landed on Earth and needs your help to get home. I'm leaning toward the green derpy one at the bottom
