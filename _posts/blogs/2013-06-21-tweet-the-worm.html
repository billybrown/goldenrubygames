Hey all,

So we're in this weird holding period with our upcoming projects, so we figured we'd delve into some social media functions for Worm Run. Andy is investigating some stuff for the OpenFrameworks and you'll all be able to tweet about your runs! Social media was severely lacking in our last games so better late then never right?

On the subject of updates, we did get this one request from someone on Twitter a few days ago:

<a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/tweet-the-worm/attachment/tweet01" rel="attachment wp-att-620"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-620" title="tweet01" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tweet01.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="55" /></a>

We know it's a bit frustrating, but we found while testing that a lot of people tended to flip the phone accidentally. This was mostly because of fear from the Worm catching them and their bodies getting so into it. If it becomes more of an issue we'd consider changing it over.

We'll let you know when the new update is available so you can all tweet your best scores out to the universe!

-Mike
