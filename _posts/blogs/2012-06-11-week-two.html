Hey Everyone!

Quick update here at Golden Ruby. We're making headway on our first game, working title: <em><strong>CamBlocks</strong></em>. Andy and I haven't killed each other yet, so I think that's a good sign.

We've had a few people come in to play-test CamBlocks and the initial reaction is that it's fun, yet challenging. It's been fun tweaking the game based on everyone's input. Though, I have to say I was probably the happiest when Andy decided to let me design a level. Now I know it may not seem like a big deal to most programmers, but when you have someone who has been playing games his entire life design his own level it's hard not to get a little giddy.

We're planning on posting some official art up here once we have some official art to post. As well as music and sound effects! That's going to be a lot of fun, bleeps and bloops all day.

If anyone else is interested in playtesting for us, send us an email at: jobs@goldenrubygames.com. If you do end up playtesting, you'll get a free copy of the game upon release and a free ride to the 77th floor of the Empire State Building. That's a $25.00 value!

Keep checking back for updates!

-Mike
