Hey friends,

So we know that you have all been waiting with bated breath for the release of <em>Destroy All Color!</em> We submitted our code to Apple last Monday and from what we know about the process, it takes about a week to 10 days to reach approval. Once we get that approval we'll be releasing the game.

From what we've gathered from our testers, we think we have a pretty good game on our hands.

In other news, last week Andy and I were joined by our friend <a href="http://kristopherknight.com/">Kristopher Knight </a>who helped us film our game trailer. Unfortunately, we can't show it to everyone right now since the game isn't released yet. Although, if you go to some <a href="https://vimeo.com/47744504">random link</a> we just happen to put on this website and use a password like <em>7706</em>, you might be able to see it for yourself.

Once <em>Destroy!</em> is released, you will be the first to know!

&nbsp;
