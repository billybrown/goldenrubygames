Hey all,

Just wanted to update you on some pretty awesome news. This weekend, Andy, Nicolas, Jane and I competed in a Sony sponsored game jam where we had one week to complete a game for the PS Mobile market; specifically the Vita.

<a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/indiecade" rel="attachment wp-att-527"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-527" title="IndieCade" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IndieCade.png" alt="" width="474" height="130" /></a>

Before we even started, the ability to get a free PS Vita for just completing a game, sparked our interest. So last Saturday we journeyed to distant Queens and set up shop at the Museum of the Moving image. With our computers ready and our minds open, we braced ourselves for the theme of the challenge: <em>Evolution!</em>

Right away my mind went straight to the idea of a space shooter in a retro 8-bit style. As you powered up you became more graphically advanced, all the way up to 32-bit. But as every game developer knows, ideas are fun, inexpensive and require no time to develop, games do not. So we downsized, aimed at the heart of what would make a good game. Our process pretty much looked like this:

<a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/indiecaderecycle" rel="attachment wp-att-528"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" title="indiecaderecycle" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/indiecaderecycle.jpg" alt="" width="652" height="458" /></a>

It was actually kind of fascinating to watch this process take place and how all four of us just took what the other said and grew off of it, managing to get back to the initial idea yet be so completely different.

<a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/img_0136" rel="attachment wp-att-529"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-529" title="IMG_0136" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0136-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

With the game finalized, we could start having fun with it. I'm not 100% certain how we decided on a hermit crab, but the idea stuck. Thus, <em>Hermit Crab in Space</em> was born.

We divided the tasks based on each other's strengths. Andy, of course handled the bulk of the code. He really wanted to make a complete game, one that had a beginning, middle and end. Looking back today, we recalled that when presenting to Sony, we never even came close to showing them the end sequence we created, but the fact we knew where it was going showed in our presentation. This was to be a fully realized universe even if no one saw it.

Jane was (and still is) a master of all trades. She helped on code, art, design, UI, sounds. She really came through in everything she helped with and the game wouldn't be where it is without her help. It was really her voice throughout the game, giving it that tongue-and-cheek feel while still being incredibly complex.

Nicolas Cinquegrani, our faithful artist, sadly, no-longer in residence. Nico had just recently taken a full time job outside of Golden Ruby and although we were sad to see him go, he was more than happy to come back and help us with this project and remind us how great he is at what he does.

A master like Nico doesn't need much time to turn something like this:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/screen1" rel="attachment wp-att-532"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-532" title="screen1" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screen1-1024x575.png" alt="" width="717" height="403" /></a></p>
<a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/screen1" rel="attachment wp-att-532">
</a>Into this:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/ship3" rel="attachment wp-att-533"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-533" title="ship3" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ship3.png" alt="" width="666" height="377" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After working with Nico on our last game, we knew what he was capable of and really brought the space faring crab to life...well his ship anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And then there was me. I'm the first one to admit I'm not really suited to do much in the technical side except break things. But I think that I managed the team well enough to get stuff done. But there's the rub, when you're working with a great team and everyone knows their strengths, its best to just let them do their thing. I did; however, provide the much needed MSPaint character portraits that gave <em>HCiS</em> the dash of flavor it needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Now with the game in place, a week of development was underway. Luckly, Andy and I already had a workspace. Nico and Jane joined us throughout the week to help with updates. We hammered out the main control scheme fairly quickly. We knew it would be a combination of touch screen utilization with the D-Pad/PS Buttons used as well. As you can see from these screens, the player shoots and destroys enemy ships. You then use your touch screen to steal broken pieces to add to your ship, or as I like to call it, your shellhull, or shull.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/photo-feb-16-11-57-03-am" rel="attachment wp-att-550"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-550" title="Photo Feb 16, 11 57 03 AM" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Photo-Feb-16-11-57-03-AM-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/blog/indiecade-east-sony-gamejam/attachment/lightfoe1" rel="attachment wp-att-551"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-551" title="lightFoe1" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lightFoe1-1024x575.png" alt="" width="614" height="345" /></a></p>

You then rotate then assign your components to one of the four PS Buttons: Circle, Cross, Square and Triangle and hope that you don't put too many guns to one button.

We tried to implement constant firing so long as the button is held, but found that the enemy AI would be drastically changed as a result. Jane tooled around with a multitude of enemy types and spent a long, long time making them feel natural to the player. We significantly shrunk the arena size for each wave so the player would spend less time hunting the pirates.

Like with all time-sensitive game jams, we did not have time to implement a few things. One thing I was really sad to cut was the shield system. Nico made this awesome sprite for us to use but just ended up sitting in our dropbox.

On Sunday, we finished our code at the hard stopping point of 4:00pm. Then, we waited, for 2 1/2 hours. With 12 other teams in the jam, we watched as one by one, each group presented to Sony. Of course we were the last team to present. One thing we all agreed on is that going first is always best, so when you have three people who despise going last, pacing around can only do so much to calm our nerves.

After our 10 minute presentation, we had a 4 minute public presentation to all of IndieCade East, and of course...we went last.

Then, we sat and waited for Sony's announcement. This was kind of a big deal as every other game in the jam with us had just as much of a chance of winning. Everyone made awesome and unique games that had us extremely nervous. I remember closing my eyes and hearing the first winning team:

<em>Don't Wake the Bear</em>

And then,

<em>Crystallon</em>

Of course we didn't get it,

<em>Crumble</em>

How fitting would it be that we were called last again...

<em>Hermit Crab in Space</em>

<em></em>We won! We're a semi-finalist. Along with being named a finalist, we each got a PS Vita (Hello Persona 4 Golden!), a ticket to GDC (plus airfare) and a year long developer licence with PlayStation Mobile!

Now, we're in the home stretch, a month to polish <em>HCiS </em>and present it to Sony one last time at GDC. The ultimate winner gets:
<ul>
	<li>Dedicated Landing Page on the PS Website</li>
	<li>PS Blogpost</li>
	<li>TWITTER BLAST</li>
	<li>Dedicated PS Forum Post</li>
