Happy Monday everyone,

Not much to update here at Golden Ruby Games. We're still working hard on Destroy All Color. We've decided to finalize our choice for K'roma, going with the blue color scheme.Â <a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/alien_girlNormal.png"><img class=" wp-image-388 alignleft" title="alien_girlNormal" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/alien_girlNormal-236x300.png" alt="" width="99" height="126" /></a>

We're also finalizing the achievement system for the Game Marketplace. Also there was a lot of boring legal and financial stuff that was taken care of that we are sure you don't want to hear about.

All in all, we're pretty excited about DAC and hope that you all will be too.
