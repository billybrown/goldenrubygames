Hey people!

So Destroy All Color is coming along swimmingly. We've pretty much completed the game, save for a few small things still left to include.

This upcoming month will be dedicated to playtesting and finding bugs within the game. We already have a crack team of friends and fans playing DAC as we speak. Thanks guys!

The rest of our time will be split between polishing up the game, submitting it for review for Apple and getting in touch with leading game review sites. If all goes well and stays on schedule, we plan on releasing Destroy! to the public come September.

Remember, if you want to be a gametester, shoot me an e-mail at mike@goldenrubygames.com. You'll be forever appreciated.

On a side note, we opened the support side of our page last week. Not a huge deal, but a deal nonetheless. (Thanks Z!)

Keep on truckin'

-Mike
