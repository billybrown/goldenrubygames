Big News indeed everybody!

<span style="text-align: center;">Here is the official image for Destroy All Color.Â <a href="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Icon@2x.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-409" title="Icon@2x" src="http://goldenrubygames.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Icon@2x.png" alt="" width="114" height="114" /></a></span>

We're nearing completion of DAC and we're looking to get some official playtesters for the month of August. If you're interested in helping us out, sign up for an account at TestFlightApp.com and send us an e-mail when you're ready to test. All testers will get a free copy of the game when it's released.

Let us know what you think!
