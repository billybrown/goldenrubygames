Hey all,

Got back from (my very first) E3 a few days ago. It truly was a dream come true and so much fun. Sony treated me with the utmost respect and I felt like a AAA developer at times.

Of course our game, Hermit Crab in Space, was a bit overshadowed by the PS4 and XBox One, but that was to be expected. All in all I met a great many people, forged some contacts and showed off the game.

Now that I'm back in New York, Andy and I are working hard to put the finishing touches on the PSM build of Hermit Crab in Space. I think my favorite part is the addition of the animated character sprites in the vain of Star Fox. We're also adding an endless mode!

If you guys have access to PSM, please pick up Hermit Crab in Space when it's released. We'll let you know when that is!
