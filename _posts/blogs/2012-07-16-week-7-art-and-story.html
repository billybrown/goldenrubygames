Happy Monday Everyone!

So we're nearing completion for Destroy all Color. These next few weeks will be fun now that we can focus on the story and overall presentation of the game. For those of you who don't know, DAC will focus on K'Roma, a derpy alien girl who crash landed to Earth after her ship was struck by an asteroid. As she was falling through our atmosphere, she flew through a rainbow and now all of these colors have clogged her engine.

Below is some concept art for the opening story. Let us know what you think!
