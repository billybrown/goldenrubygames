So for those of you who don't know, we recently celebrated our 1 year anniversary back on June 1st. We've completed 3 games in the past year\:

[Destroy All Color](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/destroy-all-color!-hd/id549937765?mt=8) for iOS \(it's Free!\)

[Worm Run](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worm-run/id569497239?mt=8) for iOS

[Hermit Crab in Space](http://www.pspminis.com/10896/hermit-crab-in-space-screens-released/) for PSM \(not yet released\)

It's been a crazy time and I cannot believe that in just a year we managed to get an exclusive feature with Sony at E3 this year.

I just thought I'd write a few words on my first year as a game developer and my thoughts moving forward.

##Teamwork is Important##

The gaming industry is great because both the individual and the large TripleA companies have just as much of a chance for making it big (even though a lot of AAA companies have boatloads of advertising cash behind them). This being said, it is so much easier to gather the people you can work well with and trust. Half the battle for us was finding the right people for our titles.

I snagged [Andy](http://andymakes.com/) as soon as he graduated from Parsons. Without his expertise, our games would not be as solid as they are. Coding is key in this industry and you better have someone who does it right.

##Don't be afraid to spend money##

Sometimes the best person or service comes with the higher price tag. By all means, shop around, do favors, get it on the cheap. But if you want the best sometimes you need to spend a good chunk of change.

##Don't Stop Working##

One of the most terrifying/exciting things in the world is to come into work and have absolutely no idea what to do next. Not because you are stuck, but because you have so many opportunities. Ultimately, you get to make your favorite projects with no one telling you that you cannot do it. But you also have to trust you're making the right decision. In the end a large portfolio is sometimes just as impressive as one highly polished title.

But regardless of how big or small your success is, you need to move on to the next thing with that same (if not more) passion.

##Learn when to Concede##

Sometimes that idea really doesn't work out. Learn to trust your teammates (and testers) in giving honest advice. You should never stop learning and the first step in that is to admit that you don't know everything.

##...##

I was going to end with "Have Fun" but that's really a given, you should love what you do.

Starting this company was truly one of the best things I've ever done. I feel more accomplished in this past year than I have in a long time.

As for the future, I hope to learn the proper and most effective way to expand Golden Ruby beyond just me and Andy. Hopefully you'll hear great things from us in the years to come and I'll post tons of things while I'm at E3.
