Hey friends!

So I know we haven't updated our blog in a while, but if you noticed we released our first game Destroy All Color! last week. So far sales have been pretty good, but we could always use more.

<strong>If you're interested in picking up the game just head<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/destroy-all-color!-hd/id549937765?mt=8"> here!</a></strong>

We had some pretty nice reviews in <a href="http://indiegames.com/2012/08/mobile_game_pick_destroy_all_c.html">IndieGames.com</a> and <a href="http://mobile.indiegamemag.com/destroy-all-color-a-puzzle-game-that-uses-your-camera/">Indie Game Magazine. </a> We hope to have a few more this week or maybe next. Also, thank you to all of our fans and friends who purchased the game. We have over 30, five-star reviews in the app store and every favorable review pushes us a little closer to being featured by Apple.

As for future projects, we have the very talented <a href="http://www.ncinquegrani.com/">Nicolas Cinquegrani</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenschappler.com/">Stephen Schappler</a> working with us on art and sounds respectively.

We can't tell you much about our next project but just remember that the<a href="http://goldenrubygames.tumblr.com/post/30935037476/the-worm-is-coming"> <em>Worm is getting closer. </em></a>
