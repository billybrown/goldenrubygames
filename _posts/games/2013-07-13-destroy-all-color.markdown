*Only you can help K'Roma the Alien get home!*

She's had a rough day; hit with an asteroid, crashing to a weird planet and smashing into a rainbow on the way down. Now her ship is clogged with color and only you with your camera can help her DESTROY IT ALL! 

The flagship title of Golden Ruby Games, Destroy All Color makes you use your environment to play the game. Use your camera to capture colors around you and use them to destroy colored blocks in a gaggle of unique and challenging levels. 

Use your camera to capture unique colors in your environment. 
Test your skill in 5 different worlds with *100 unique levels*. 
Aim for crazy power ups like the Laser or Bomb to help you out. 
Avoid Poison blocks like the Mirror or Hyper Block that will try and trip you up. 
See how far you can make it in *Endless Mode*, where the blocks only stop when you can't keep up.
